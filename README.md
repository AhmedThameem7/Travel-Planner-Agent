# 💬 AI Travel Planner Agent

An AI-powered assistant that helps users plan travel experiences based on personal preferences, budget, and trip duration. Built entirely using **IBM Watsonx.ai**, this intelligent agent provides personalized travel itineraries, destination recommendations, budget estimates, and more — all through natural language interaction.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

A Travel Planner Agent is an AI-powered assistant that helps users plan trips efficiently
and intelligently.
It uses real-time data to suggest destinations, build itineraries, and recommend transport and
accommodation options.
By understanding user preferences, budgets, and constraints, it tailors personalized travel plans.
Integrated with maps, weather updates, and local guides, it ensures a smooth travel experience.
The agent can also manage bookings, alert users to changes, and optimize schedules on the go.
This smart assistant transforms complex travel planning into a seamless, enjoyable process.


## 💡 Proposed Solution

An AI travel planner agent built using IBM Watsonx.ai that delivers tailored travel guidance via conversational prompts. By leveraging large language models, the agent generates complete travel itineraries, budget breakdowns, and destination suggestions — in seconds and without needing to code.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- IBM Watsonx.ai Prompt Lab
- IBM Granite Foundation Model (LLM)
- Prompt chaining and prompt templates
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- IBM Cloud (Lite) for workspace and model hosting

## ☁️ IBM Cloud Services Used

- Watsonx.ai Studio
- IBM Granite Model
- IBM Cloud IAM
- IBM Cloud Lite Account

## 👥 End Users

- Casual travelers
- Budget travelers
- Solo backpackers
- Students and educators
- Travel influencers
- NGOs organizing travel for social projects
- Corporate employees planning business/leisure trips

## 🌟 WOW Factors

- Built completely within Watsonx.ai 
- Generates multi-day itineraries in seconds
- Suggests travel destinations based on user input
- Offers cost-conscious trip planning
- Handles off-topic or unsupported requests with polite redirection
- Future-ready for multilingual and voice input support

## 🧪 Key Features

- Personalized travel suggestions using prompt engineering
- Multi-day itinerary generation with detailed activity suggestions
- Context-aware responses for dates, budget, location
- Graceful handling of unrelated or inappropriate inputs
- Easily extensible via prompt tuning or document grounding (RAG)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User inputs a query (e.g., “Plan a 7-day budget trip to Thailand in November”)
2. IBM Granite LLM processes the query using Prompt Lab
3. Pre-defined prompts guide the model to generate structured and grounded travel plans
4. The agent outputs a complete response (itinerary, travel advice, budget estimation)
